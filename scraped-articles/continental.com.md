First Quarter 2022: Continental Reports Strong Tire Business in the First Quarter
## content
Weak automotive production in the first quarter

In the first three months of the year, global automotive production was significantly lower than in the first quarter of the previous year. The market for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in Europe fell particularly sharply (3.8 million units, -19.1 percent). North America also recorded a slightly weaker start to the year compared with the previous year’s quarter

(3.6 million units, -1.8 percent). In China, the production of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles was up year-on-year (6.1 million units, +6.1 percent). According to preliminary figures, global production of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles fell by 4.5 percent compared with the first quarter of 2021 to a total of 19.7 million units (Q1 2021: 20.7 million units).

Development of the group sectors

The weak automotive production in conjunction with increasing procurement and logistics costs impacted the Automotive group sector in particular. Its sales increased by 3.2 percent to €4.2 billion (Q1 2021: €4.1 billion). After adjusting for exchange-rate effects and changes in the scope of consolidation, it posted organic sales growth of -1.2 percent. The Automotive group sector therefore outperformed the market, with global automotive production falling by 4.5 percent in the first quarter of this year. Its adjusted EBIT margin was -3.9 percent (Q1 2021: 2.4 percent).

The Tires group sector achieved a good result, recording increased sales volumes in the car tires and commercial-vehicle tires replacement business compared with the previous year. With sales of €3.3 billion (Q1 2021: €2.7 billion, +20.1 percent), it achieved an adjusted EBIT margin of 17.1 percent (Q1 2021: 16.6 percent). Inventory valuation had a positive effect of around €200 million on earnings due to increased acquisition and production costs.

The considerable cost increases for procurement and logistics also affected the ContiTech group sector, which posted sales of €1.6 billion (Q1 2021: €1.5 billion, +3.3 percent) and an adjusted EBIT margin of 5.4 percent (Q1 2021: 10.2 percent). The conveyor belt and industrial hose businesses performed particularly well. Sales in the drive belt and air spring replacement business also rose.

Expectations for fiscal 2022

Market developments will continue to be characterized by high volatility in the coming months. After a production output of 77.1 million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles last year, Continental expects an increase of between 4 and 6 percent for the year as a whole (previously: 6 to 9 percent). Negative effects from cost inflation for key inputs, especially for

oil-based raw materials as well as for energy and logistics in Tires and ContiTech, continue to become significantly more material.

Continental has therefore adjusted its outlook for the year as a whole, as reported

on April 21, 2022. Consolidated sales are now expected to be around €38.3 billion to €40.1 billion (previously: around €38 billion to €40 billion), and the adjusted EBIT margin is expected to be around 4.7 to 5.7 percent (previously: around 5.5 to 6.5 percent).

For the Automotive group sector, Continental expects sales of around €17.8 billion to €18.8 billion (previously: around €18 billion to €19 billion) and an adjusted EBIT margin in the range

of around -0.5 to 1 percent (previously: around 0 to 1.5 percent). This still includes higher procurement and logistics expenses of around €1 billion as well as additional expenses for research and development of around €100 million in the Autonomous Mobility business area.

For the Tires group sector, Continental expects sales of around €13.8 billion to €14.2 billion (previously: around €13.3 billion to €13.8 billion) and an adjusted EBIT margin

of around 12.0 to 13.0 percent (previously: around 13.5 to 14.5 percent).

This includes a year-on-year increase in procurement and logistics costs

of around €1.9 billion (previously: around €1 billion).

For the ContiTech group sector, sales of around €6.3 billion to €6.5 billion

(previously: around €6.0 billion to €6.3 billion) and an adjusted EBIT margin of around 6.0 to 7.0 percent (previously: around 7.0 to 8.0 percent) are expected. This includes a year-on-year increase in procurement and logistics costs of around €600 million

(previously: around €300 million).

Capital expenditure before financial investments is expected to total around 6 percent of sales (previously: less than 7 percent).

Adjusted free cash flow is expected to be around €0.6 billion to €1.0 billion (previously: around €0.7 billion to €1.2 billion).

In the event the geopolitical situation, in particular in Eastern Europe, remains tense or worsens, it could result in further lasting consequences for production, supply chains and demand. In addition, further negative effects could arise as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the related supply situation. Depending on the severity of the disruption, this may result in lower sales and especially earnings in all group sectors as well as for the Continental Group compared to the prior year.
